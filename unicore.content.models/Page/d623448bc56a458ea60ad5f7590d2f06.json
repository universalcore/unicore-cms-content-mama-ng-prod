Sex does not cause pregnancy loss.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you feel pain in your belly, you are bleeding, or you had problems in a previous pregnancy, talk to your healthcare provider first. It may be safer not to have sex until after your baby is born, but let your healthcare provider guide you.\r\n\r\nYou may feel uncomfortable and may not want to have sex. Many women feel like that. Try to show love in other ways.\r\n\r\nIf you are leaking fluid from below (a discharge) or you are itching and you want to have sex, use a condom. It is safer. If you notice a discharge, you should also go to the health facility when you can.\r\n \r\nIt is a good idea to always use condoms while you are pregnant. They protect you and your baby against infections you can get from sex and from HIV.\r\n\r\nYou can get infections from having any type of sex with someone who has an infection.\r\n\r\nThese infections can make you and your baby very sick. A healthcare provider will test you for infections and will help you to manage them. Symptoms to look for include a rash around your vagina or pain when you urinate.\r\n\r\nRemember, you can have an infection with no symptoms. So it is a good idea to get tested.\r\n",
