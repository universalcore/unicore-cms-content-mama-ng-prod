  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is always safest to have your baby in a health facility. A health facility can give you a clean labour and your baby will have a safer start in life. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is born, he is attached to you by a cord, which needs to be cut. When you give birth at a health facility, the cord will be cut in a hygienic way that does not cause infections. \r\n\r\nIf your baby comes too quickly so you cannot get to the health facility in time, you will need to take care of the baby\u2019s cord.\r\n\r\nYou will need a clean sheet to have your baby on, 2 pieces of clean string and 2 cloths: one to dry your baby and one to wrap her in, and a clean, sharp knife or a clean pair of scissors.\r\n\r\nBoil the knife for 10 minutes and the string for 3 minutes to clean them, just before you use them.\r\n\r\nHave clean, safe water and soap ready, so the birth attendant can wash her hands very carefully before she cuts the cord.\r\n\r\nWait until the cord stops pulsing. Then, tie the 2 pieces of string round the cord. One tie should be about the length of your hand away from your baby's tummy. The other, about 3 fingers away from the first tie. Cut the cord in between the 2 ties. \r\n\r\nKeep your baby's cord stump clean and dry until it drops off.\r\n\r\nGo to the health facility with your baby as soon as you can.\r\n",
