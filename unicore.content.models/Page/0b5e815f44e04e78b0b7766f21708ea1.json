Eat energy giving foods like rice, yam, and potatoes, and body building foods like meat, chicken, fish and beans regularly. Add cashew nuts and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like oranges, watermelon and pineapples are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n2.\tGet check-ups while you are pregnant. Visit your healthcare provider at least 4 times.
