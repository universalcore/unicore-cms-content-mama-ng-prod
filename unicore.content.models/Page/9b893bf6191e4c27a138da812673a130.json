The best way to know is when you have missed your period, but you may find it hard to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYour breasts look and feel different \r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou feel like vomiting\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou need to urinate more than usual \r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you see a healthcare provider. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new baby. A healthcare provider will also be able to give you advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe healthcare provider will weigh you, check your blood pressure and test your urine. \r\n\r\nWorried about seeing a healthcare provider? Ask a friend to go with you.\r\n",
